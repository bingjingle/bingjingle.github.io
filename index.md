For now I am a a statistical analyst at the [graduate school](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/index.html) of [Purdue University](http://purdue.edu). Before joining Media Lab, I obtained my MS degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu) in 2014, and my BA degree in Management Information System from [Beijing Language and Culture University](http://english.blcu.edu.cn) in 2012.

Currently I'm applying for the Ph.D. in Statistics. Please refer to my [Curriculum Vitae](http://bingjingle.github.io/cv.pdf) for details. Thanks.
